# Live Code

This repo contains all code written by instructors during lecture. Hopefully this code supplements what's in the lecture slides and can help you all with homework assignments and projects.

### Architecture

For each semester of the course, there is a folder. Each folder should contain a folder for each lecture in which the instructor wrote code. Instructors should push updates at the end of each lecture.
